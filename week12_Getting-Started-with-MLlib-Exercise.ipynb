It investigates a binary classification problem - can you predict if an individual's income is greater than $50,000 based on demographic data? The dataset is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult) and is provided with Databricks Runtime. This notebook demonstrates some of the capabilities available in MLlib, including tools for data preprocessing, machine learning pipelines, and several different machine learning algorithms.\n\nThis notebook includes the following steps:\n\n0. Load the dataset\n0. Feature preprocessing\n0. Define the model\n0. Build the pipeline\n0. Evaluate the model\n0. Hyperparameter tuning\n0. Make predictions and evaluate model performance\n\n## Requirements\nDatabricks Runtime 7.0 or above or Databricks Runtime 7.0 ML or above.

important concepts in MLlib machine learning that are illustrated in this notebook are **Transformers**, **Estimators**, and **Pipelines**. \n\n- **Transformer**: Takes a DataFrame as input, and returns a new DataFrame. Transformers do not learn any parameters from the data and simply apply rule-based transformations to either prepare data for model training or generate predictions using a trained MLlib model. You call a transformer with a `.transform()` method.\n\n- **Estimator**: Learns (or \"fits\") parameters from your DataFrame via a `.fit()` method and returns a Model, which is a transformer.\n\n- **Pipeline**: Combines multiple steps into a single workflow that can be easily run. Creating a machine learning model typically involves setting up many different steps and iterating over them. Pipelines help you automate this process.\n\nFor more information:\n[ML Pipelines](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-pipeline.html#ml-pipelines)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"cd385428-b571-446b-a5ef-e48045a57a06"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Step 2.

The Adult dataset includes categorical features such as education, occupation, and marital status. \n\nThe following code block illustrates how to use `StringIndexer` and `OneHotEncoder` to convert categorical variables into a set of numeric variables that only take on values 0 and 1. \n\n- `StringIndexer` converts a column of string values to a column of label indexes. For example, it might convert the values \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\" to 0, 1, and 2. \n- `OneHotEncoder` maps a column of category indices to a column of binary vectors, with at most one \"1\" in each row that indicates the category index for that row.\n\nOne-hot encoding in Spark is a two-step process. You first use the StringIndexer, followed by the OneHotEncoder. The following code block defines the StringIndexer and OneHotEncoder but does not apply it to any data yet.\n\nFor more information:   \n[StringIndexer](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#stringindexer)   \n[OneHotEncoder](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-features.html#onehotencoder)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"title":"","showTitle":false,"inputWidgets":{},"nuid":"b085060b-d530-4b1f-a322-f01e602caa3d"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark.ml.feature import StringIndexer, OneHotEncoder\n\ncategoricalCols = [\"workclass\", \"education\", \"marital_status\", \"occupation\", \"relationship\", \"race\", \"sex\"]\n\n# The following two lines are estimators.
